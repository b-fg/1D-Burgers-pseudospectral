                          1D Burgers equation pseudo-spectral solver

      														du   1  d               d^2
      														-- + -- -- (u*u) = nu * ---- (u)
      														dt   2  dx              dx^2

	The analytical solution considered is

     u(x,t) = 4 - 2 * nu * d/dx(phi(x,t)) / phi(x,0)

	where

     phi(x,t) = exp(-(x-4*t     ) / (4*nu*(t+1)))
              + exp(-(x-4*t-2*pi) / (4*nu*(t+1)))

	Periodic boundary conditions are considered for a [0,2*pi] domain

			u(0,t) = u(2*pi,t)

  The FFTW3 library is required for the FFT and IFFT transforms.
